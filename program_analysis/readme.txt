 - modified original .g file according to teacher's .g file
 - NO error handling while building AST
 - getter and setter methods are added for graph building purpose in all the statement classes
 - toString method is added for all the ast classes
 - run TheLang class if you want to run the example program
 - run Main class if you just want to see the AST

 - take a look at the Main class under the default folder to know how to start to generate graphs
 - Need to do: Test the parser thoroughly
